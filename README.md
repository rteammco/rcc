Robot Command Center
===

Robot Command Center is a Java client written to send commands to a robot (Cyclops) over the Internet and receive live video from the robot's on-board camera.

RCC uses a custom networking protocol designed to interact with multiple robots. Commands and messages are sent using TCP, while video transmission is done via UDP. RCC also features a customized GUI built on top of Java's Graphics2D API.

This client was made as a part of a larger robotics project in summer 2011.
